1. Introduction

The SIC Assembler is a software tool used for translating assembly language programs written in the Simplified Instructional Computer (SIC) machine language into object code that can be executed on a SIC machine. The SIC machine is a hypothetical computer system introduced by Leland Beck in his book System Software: An Introduction to Systems Programming.
2. Installation

Currently, there are several versions of the SIC Assembler available, each with its own installation process. Below are general steps:

    Download: Download the SIC Assembler package from the designated source.
    Extract: Extract the contents of the package to a directory of your choice.
    Compile (if required): Depending on the version of the SIC Assembler, you may need to compile the source code using an appropriate compiler.
    Setup: Follow any specific setup instructions provided in the README or documentation accompanying the package.

3. Usage

Using the SIC Assembler typically involves the following steps:

    Write Your Assembly Code: Create or write your assembly language program in a text editor. Ensure that it adheres to the syntax and rules of the SIC assembly language.
    Save Your Code: Save your assembly code with an appropriate file extension (e.g., .asm).
    Invoke the Assembler: Run the SIC Assembler, providing your assembly code file as input.
    Check Output: The assembler will generate object code as output. Check for any errors or warnings reported during the assembly process.
    Execute Object Code: Once successfully assembled, the generated object code can be executed on a SIC machine.

4. Features

The features of the SIC Assembler may vary depending on the version and implementation. However, typical features include:

    Translation of assembly language programs into object code.
    Error checking and reporting.
    Support for various directives and instructions of the SIC assembly language.
    Symbol resolution and address calculation.
    Generation of load modules or executable files.
